<p><h2>1. Introduction to FabLab and Fab Academy</h2></p>

<p>FabLab has interesting computer controlled machines and instruments 
which can be used to make almost anything. As of now, FabLab cannot be used for mass manufacturing, but for prototyping innovative products. Now Fablab is a collaborative global network spread across many countries. As per records, there are a total of 565 FabLabs around the world. And we have two here in Kerala and 
I am lucky to be a part FabLab Kochi. I am truly looking forward to make a Fab movement in Kerala. </p>

    Fab Academy happens every year from January to June 2016. The online interactive classes for the course "How to make almost anything" are conducted by Prof.
Neil Gershenfeld, the co-founder of FabLab,  every Wednesday in between this period. Assignments will be give to participants on a weekly basis. All students also needs to complete and present a project by the end of the course. </p>

<p>Luciano Betoldi, our Fablab trainer started off the workshop by rearranging and cleaning the lab in the best way to suit the Pre Fab workshop. This was followed by a self introduction session. By the second day, we had 8 members attending the workshop at Kochi FabLab. 
    
FabLab Kochi is located at Startup Village, Kinfra Hi-Tech Park, Kochi, India. The lab has been setup by Kerala Startup Mission. Its been only a few months since we have setup this lab and the response has been great. We had a few startups who are incubated at Startup Village.

<p><h2><a id="intro" name="intro">2. Assignement:</a> Ubuntu on Virtual Box</h2></p>

<p>The fab modules for using FabLab machines/equipments runs best on Ubuntu and I have always adored Ubuntu and all the open source stuff. But I have been using mac for quite sometime now for my work and I haven’t got the time to explore and play around with Ubuntu. 
</p>

<p>I took this opportunity to install virtual ubuntu on my mac using virtual box.  Virtual Box virtual machine is a free virtualisation software by Oracle that can be downloaded from the internet. This allows you to install and run ubuntu on top of my mac.
</p>



<p>The method to get is done is fairly simple.</p>

<p>1. Download the Virtual Box Software from the web, Install it.<br>
2. Download the ubuntu installation iso file from the web. <br>
3. Install it on mac through virtual box.<br>

</p>
<p> <br>  Downloaded and installed Virtual Box from link: 

 <a href=https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a> 
</p>

<p><br> Downloaded Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS from link: <a href=http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop>http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop</a>  </p>

<p><br> Installed Ubuntu on Virtual Box</p>

<p>All I had to to do was to press the start button and Ubuntu was up an running on a seperate window in OSX. To my surprise, its running pretty smoothly. Thanks to the 8GB RAM on my macbook. :)

</p>

<p>Once virtual Ubuntu was installed on Mac, I checked out Fab Modules. This simple web software works like a wonder and is made to operate any FabLab machine. </p>

<p>The compiled version was downloaded from the website. <br><br>
    
    <a href=http://kokompe.cba.mit.edu/>http://kokompe.cba.mit.edu/</a> 
</p>


 <br>

After downloading the file, I used the terminal to install dependencies to get started with FabModules. The dependencies on Ubuntu can be installed using the command. <br><br>

sudo apt-get install python python-wxgtk2.8 python-dev python-pip gcc g++ libpng12-dev libgif-dev make bash okular libboost-thread-dev libboost-system-dev cmake <br><br>

To setup fab modules on Ubuntu, fab_src.zip was unzipped to a folder. I navigated to the that unzipped folder through terminal and typed the following commands to setup Fab Modules. <br> <br>



<b>make fab </b><br> <br>


<b>make install</b> <br> <br>


Once this is done, the Fab Modules can be opened by typing ‘fab’ on terminal from that particular folder.  <br> <br>


There is also a web version which is neat and easy to use. We just need to visit the following website <br> <br>

<b> <a href=http://fabmodules.org/>http://fabmodules.org/</a></b> <br>

<br> <br>

The input format and the output device can be chosen from a drop down list, the design file can be uploaded and that it is. This is the easiest and straight forward way touse a device.
