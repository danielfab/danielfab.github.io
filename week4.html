<p><h2><b>Week 4 </h2></b></p>

<p><h3><b>Day 1:  </b></h3></p>

<p><h4>Electronics Design, Production & Programming </h4></p>

<p>The day started off with Fransisco giving a quick overview of the Fab Academy through a quick presentation and also explained about the one week project. The idea of a one week project is to choose and complete a simple well crafted project in one week instead of going complicated project.</p> 

<p><h4>Kokopelli</h4></p>

<p>Francisco then introduced Kokopelli, an interesting software developed by Matt Keeter for designing electronic circuit boards through code. 

I installed Kokopelli on Virtualbox ubuntu on my mac and all the dependencies were installed on Ubuntu. However, I was not able to get it work on my Ubuntu. </p>

<p>https://github.com/mkeeter/kokopelli/wiki/Installing</p>

<p>I used the instructions available on the above given link and also added all the Python libraries through pip. 

Fransisco explained how components can be added by adding code snippets from the code inventory created by Niel. </p>

<p>As my documentation website was not live. Francisco shared a catch up plan and I was asked to make the website live before I leave the lab. The website is live now and all my documentation for the previous weeks needs to be added. Thats it for today.</p>




</p>

<p><h3><b>Day 2:  </b></h3></p>

<p><h4>Clean Up Task </h4></p>

<p>The day started with Francisco explaining about the important of cleaning up. This was followed by a quick clean up task. Within few minutes we removed all the rubbles and the lab was neat once again. </p> 

<p><h4> Continuing with Kokopelli</h4></p>

<p>Finally I figured out how to fix the Kokopelli installation issue and it was running fine on myVirtuabox Ubuntu.

<p>Proff. Neil has created an inventory of electronic components inside a 4000 line code. In order to add components into a design, the code snippets can be taken from the code created by Niel and added to our design accordingly. </p>

<p>Todays task was to add three additional components: A resistor, a button and an LED to the hello ftdi board design. This was done by adding the following code to the existing code.</p>

<p>I used the instructions available on the above given link and also added all the Python libraries through pip. </p>

Fransisco explained how components can be added by adding code snippets from the code inventory created by Niel. </p>

<p>LED1 = LED_1206('LED1');
pcb=LED1.add(pcb,XTAL1.x,IC1.pad[5].y,z,180)</p>

<p>pcb = wire(pcb,w,
   IC1.pad[5],
  LED1.pad[1])</p>

<p>R1 = R_1206('R1');
pcb = R1.add(pcb, LED1.pad[2].x, J1.pad[3].y,z,90)</p>


<p>pcb = wire(pcb,w,
   LED1.pad[1],
  R1.pad[2])</p>

<p>pcb = wire(pcb,w,
   J1.pad[6],
  R1.pad[1])</p>

<p>BT1 = button_6mm('BT1');
pcb = BT1.add(pcb,LED1.pad[1].x+.14, J1.pad[3].y-.06,z)</p>

<p>pcb = wire(pcb,w,
   IC1.pad[7],
  BT1.pad[1])</p>

<p>pcb = wire(pcb,w,
   J1.pad[6],
  BT1.pad[3])</p>
