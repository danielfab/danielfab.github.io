<p><h2><b>Week 4 </h2></b></p>

<p><h3>Day 1:  </h3></p>

<p><h4>Electronics Design, Production & Programming </h4></p>

<p>The day started off with Fransisco giving a quick overview of the Fab Academy through a quick presentation and also explained about the one week project. The idea of a one week project is to choose and complete a simple well crafted project in one week instead of going complicated project.</p> 

<p><h4>Kokopelli</h4></p>

<p>Francisco then introduced Kokopelli, an interesting software developed by Matt Keeter for designing electronic circuit boards through code. 

I installed Kokopelli on Virtualbox ubuntu on my mac and all the dependencies were installed on Ubuntu. However, I was not able to get it work on my Ubuntu. </p>

<p>https://github.com/mkeeter/kokopelli/wiki/Installing</p>

<p>I used the instructions available on the above given link and also added all the Python libraries through pip. 

Fransisco explained how components can be added by adding code snippets from the code inventory created by Niel. </p>

<p>As my documentation website was not live. Francisco shared a catch up plan and I was asked to make the website live before I leave the lab. The website is live now and all my documentation for the previous weeks needs to be added. Thats it for today.</p>
